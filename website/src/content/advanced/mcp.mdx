# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Alith supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), a technique that enables AI models to dynamically
integrate external services and data sources during inference. This protocol acts as a bridge
between LLMs and various tools/APIs, allowing models to:

- Access real-time context from external systems (GitHub, databases, APIs, etc.).
- Extend capabilities without retraining by connecting to specialized tools.
- Maintain fresh knowledge through live data connections.
- Execute complex workflows via chained service integrations.

The protocol operates through lightweight server adapters defined in the configuration file. Each MCP server:

- Runs as a separate process using native runtime (Node.js/Python).
- Implements standardized interfaces for tool discovery and execution.
- Can chain multiple services through semantic routing.
- Maintains security through process isolation.

## Read MCP Servers from Config

```rust
use alith::{Agent, Chat, LLM};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
    let model = LLM::from_model_name("gpt-4")?;
    let agent = Agent::new("simple agent", model)
        .preamble("You are a calculator here to help the user perform arithmetic operations. Use the tools provided to answer the user's question.")
        .mcp_config_path("servers_config.json").await?;
    let response = agent.prompt("Calculate 10 - 3").await?;
    println!("{}", response);
    Ok(())
}
```

An example of MCP config servers is as follows

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: Note that most MCP servers are written in Python or Node.js,
> you need to install the Python package manage tool `uv` and the Node.js
> package manage tool `npx`

## Read MCP Servers from Config

```python
from alith import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="Calculator Agent",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    preamble="You are a calculator here to help the user perform arithmetic operations. Use the tools provided to answer the user's question.",
    mcp_config_path="servers_config.json",
)
print(agent.prompt("Calculate 10 - 3"))
```

## Write an MCP Server

Of course, writing an MCP Server is also easy. Here, we take using Python to write a simple Web3 interactive MCP Server as an example.

- Install the `mcp` dependency.

```shell
python3 -m pip install mcp -U
```

- Write the MCP Server code named `mcp_server.py`.

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from web3 import Web3

# Initialize the MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("MetisBlockServer")

# Connect to Metis mainnet
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider("https://andromeda.metis.io/?owner=1088"))


# MCP Tool: Fetch Latest Block Number (already working)
@mcp.tool()
def get_latest_block() -> int:
    """Fetches the latest block number from Metis mainnet."""
    return w3.eth.block_number


# MCP Tool: Fetch Previous Block Number (already working)
@mcp.tool()
def get_previous_block() -> int:
    """Fetches the previous block number from Metis mainnet."""
    latest_block = get_latest_block()
    return latest_block - 1


# Run the MCP server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Then you can append the following config to your MCP config file `servers_config.json`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "metis": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

At last, you can run the Alith agent code.

```python
from alith import Agent

agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4",
    mcp_config_path="servers_config.json",
)
print(agent.prompt("What is the latest block number on Metis mainnet?"))
```
